Upstream canonical: asgarimehdi/h-dashboard (beta); each server has its own fork — never hardcode, read `git remote -v` first. On this box origin is this account's own h-dashboard fork; working branch `sonia` (tracks origin/beta). Uses Livewire 4 (single-file anonymous-class components), MaryUI (DaisyUI), Alpine.js, PostgreSQL+PostGIS, Redis, Sanctum auth. Persian/RTL. AGENTS.md is authoritative project instructions.
